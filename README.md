### Summary
This website represents all the work that I have done in my Composing Digital Media course. Here you will find an audio narrative project that tells the story of how Mario Lemiuex saved the Pittsburgh Penguins from relocation, along with a video essay about the lack of a salary cap in Major League Baseball.
